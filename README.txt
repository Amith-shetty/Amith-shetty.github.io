First of its kind on H5U! Astral features a flat, minimalistic design, a fully animated
interface (with noscript fallbacks), and styling for all basic page elements (including
blockquotes, tables and lists). Enjoy!



PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
